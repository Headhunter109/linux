						    Memory bandwidth Controller
						   ============================

Abstract
--------

The The memory bandwidth controller is used control the memory bandwidth consumed
individual tasks. The idea is that restricting the low priority tasks from doing
huge amount of load and store operations stalling memory operations of higher
priority tasks

Usage
-----
Memory bandwidth is controlled by the notion of weight (allowed values 0-100),
Where value of 0 indicates unrestricted bandwidth. Values from 1 to 100 helps
in scaling numebr of allowed memory operations.

Note that any task inside the cgroup will have same restriction applied when
they are scheduled. Bandwidth limitation of a task in cgroup is not limited
because of number of sibling processes that are consuming bandwidth in the
current implemenation.

Root cgroup will have no restriction and membw restriction is applicab;le only to
child cgroups.

Example
-------

First, we mount the membw controller:
# mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/membw
# mount -t cgroup -o membw none /sys/fs/cgroup/membw
#cd /sys/fs/cgroup/membw
#mkdir a
#cd a
#echo $$ > tasks
#echo 10 > membw.weight
##<Run a task here>
#echo 0 > membw.weight
##<Run same task here>

You should notice the diference in throughput when membw is set to 0 and 10 if the
task does considerable amount of load and store opeartions is normal usage.
